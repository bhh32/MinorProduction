The Pefab folder is for Jacob and Bryan to drop completed Assets with models/textures(UI)/Scripts attached. This will be used to make 
things more modular, and for us to be able to put working things in the world much faster and if needed through code 
(Instatiation *Artists ask if you're curious because the more you know about what we do the better communication we can have, 
same goes for us with you.). If you're an artist please DO NOT put anything in this folder even if you think that your asset is complete!
We still have to refine models with colliders and possibly rigidbodies, so raw models are never complete. A programmer will be assigned to create prefabs of any prop model or character model once they are
ready to go in game prefabs for the environment artist and programmer to use. This may be to just put a collider on something, or something more
advanced such as an interaction script but on it. Either way the programmers will handle the prefab side of things.

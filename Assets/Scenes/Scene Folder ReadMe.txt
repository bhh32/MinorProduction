Everyone will have their own scene. I expect Betty and Nicole's scenes to be empty at all times. They are only there for you to get
a size reference for everything else in the game. Once your models are sized and completed put them in your respective model folders
and delete them from your scene. They will be placed where they need to go by the envrionment artist/level designer in the environment
scene. The development scene is for finalized gameplay assets only (i.e. when the player is ready to stay in the scene forever, or the HUD
is ready to be persistent in the scene. Bryan and Jacob's scenes will be used for development only. Once the current asset is completed
(i.e. Player is ready to roam the world forever, or Pause Menu is ready to be implemented in game) they are to be made prefabs, moved out of our
perspective scene and into the development scene. All environmental elements will be placed by the environmental artist and only the environment
programmer is to touch any environment triggers/collisions that may be needed. All of these rules are in place to reduce programming script
conflicts and losing any model information.

This folder has two folders nested inside it. One is for the artists (which will have their own folder nested inside it), and one is for
the programmers (again, who will have their own folder nested inside it). The artist folder is for all of the animation .fbx files. The 
programmer folder is for the programmers to drop any animation controllers that are needed for the characters they are assigned to program
animations for. I know that this may sounds confusing, but programmers must create scripts for the models to access the artists animation files.
So, we must work together on this particular avenue very well.
